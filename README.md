# Odin Stuff
Mostly just testing out the language, theres a hello world program in here, a simple "hello triangle" opengl program, and then Heraclitus.

## Heraclitus
Heraclitus is a rendering technique testbed. Since OpenGL is a relatively simple graphics api and Odin is C-like with some helpers and different syntax, I'm using this program to test stuff before implementing them in C and Vulkan for my other main project, Ekwos.
